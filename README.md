## About the Game

Waves Crash is an in-progress game fully developed using React Native. It is optimized for Web, Android, and iOS, leveraging the latest React Native libraries for seamless cross-platform compatibility.

## How to Play

1. Swipe up to start.
2. When an enemy boat attacks, swipe up to crash them with waves!
3. Try again!

## Current Status & Future Plans

Waves Crash is still under development. The current game engine version is being rewritten to transition from an object-oriented to a fully functional approach. The goal is to optimize memory usage, enhance performance, and improve event handling.

The rewrite aims to:

- Make all systems run entirely as worklets.
- Establish event-driven architecture.
- Minimize shared value references for memory efficiency.

This project is an ongoing experiment to push the boundaries of React Native for game development. Stay tuned for updates!

## Contributions & Support

I'm actively developing this engine and game while seeking remote work opportunities to fund further development. If you're interested in supporting or contributing, feel free to reach out or check out the latest progress on the dedicated branch.

Happy coding & enjoy the game!
